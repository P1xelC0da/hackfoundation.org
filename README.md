# The Hack Foundation
The Hack Foundation was founded in 2016 to support the operations of Hack Club, a movement of 13,000 teenage programmers learning and making together.

Today, the foundation partners with over 330 non-profit organizations including Hack Clubs, hackathons, Little League teams, newspapers, and everything in between to act as their legal and financial entity.

Our innovative program allows anyone with a vision to build something meaningful because we believe in a world where social entrepreneurs who are are working toward better and stronger communities face no barriers towards doing good.
