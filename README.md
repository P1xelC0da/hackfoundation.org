# The Hack Foundation
The Hack Foundation was founded in 2016 to serve as the legal entity for Hack Club, a nonprofit network of high schoolers creating the coding education they wish they could receive.

Today, The Hack Foundation is the largest fiscal sponsor for teen-led projects in the world. From Hack Clubs, to hackathons, to Little League teams and community organizations, hundreds of diverse groups with annual budgets from $100 to $250,000 are powered by the infrastructure created, designed, and coded by Hack Club teenagers across America, including Hack Club HQ itself.

Every year, tens of thousands of people are impacted by organizations operating under The Hack Foundation. Partnered organizations receive the benefits of 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, administrative and backoffice support, and financial oversight.
